## Figma to Code

### In this repository I transformd great-looking Figma mockups into Pixel-perfect usable user interfaces.

### 1. A Simple Card 

#### Figma - https://www.figma.com/file/wzAjc1CgGZ0o2S3X9xRaBP/A-Simple-Card?node-id=0%3A1

#### The first challenge introduces you to Figma and recaps em and rem units before letting you loose with creating those near pixel-perfect elements. Topics covered include CSS grid, SVGs as links, and media queries. 

### 2. A Simple Landing Page 

#### This challenge introduces a range of topics including creating a hero image, forms and buttons, leaving you with a slick landing page that you can adapt for your own projects.

### 5. Drone Event Landing Page 

#### This mind-blowing project lets you show off everything you’ve learned so far, plus pick up some awesome skills you might not already know. As well as creating pro-looking animated elements, styling quotes, and advanced CSS grid practice, we’ll also create another stylish form and animated nav bar, to cement your knowledge from earlier in the course.
